# Mini Tambola Game Caller 🎲

A simple command-line Python script that simulates the "Caller" in a game of Tambola (Housie). This program generates random numbers, tracks the game progress, and ensures no number is repeated.

> **Note:** This is a demonstration version currently set to generate numbers from **1 to 6**.

## 🚀 Features

* **Random Generation:** Picks numbers randomly from the available pool.
* **Duplicate Prevention:** Automatically removes called numbers so they are never repeated.
* **Live Tracking:** Displays:
    * The number just called.
    * A sorted list of all previous numbers.
    * The count of remaining numbers.
* **User Control:** The game progresses only when you press Enter, giving players time to mark their tickets.
